# Lab 1 - Rock Paper Scissors

This Lab is to recreate the popular game Rock Paper Scissors. You have the ability to write the lab as a front end application, or a back end application (NodeJS).

The purpose of this lab is to get an understanding of your JavaScript abilities.

The rules for the game are the same though:

- The game will ask the user to choose between **Rock**, **Paper** or **Scissors**.
- The game will then auto generate a choice for the computer between rock, paper or scissors.

### The game will determine who won with the following rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
- If both choices are the same, the result is a tie and the user will be asked to choose again.
  Once you finish the round, you will be asked to play again (yes or no).
  If yes, you will select again, if no the game will show you the amount of Wins/Ties/Loses.

### It is up to you how you:

- ask the user to make a choice
- ask to replay
- show the interface
